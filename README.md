## Analysis of effect of CoPilot on my programming for tasks 3 and 4

| Impact                   | Positive         | Negative    |
|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| on Learning                | Gave a better understanding of C, I was able to use CoPilot to reverse-engineer a lot of code and deduce things. This allowed me to understand things clearly such as datastructures, pointers (to some degree) and the overall code structure of the program. It also helped with learning some C-specific principles like Forward-declarations and memory allocation. Overall, Thanks to CoPilot and other sources, I would probably be able to build something similar  and actually understand each component of it.   | Sometimes Copilot taught me the wrong thing or suggested something completely incorrect. This did not only hinder my Productivity, but it also confused me alot and caused my to doubt my understanding of C. This led to me needing to refer to non-AI based information at certain points to get back on track. WHile it may of helped me learning C, it also wasn't always a smooth and streamlined learning experience; there were many ups and many downs.|
| on Productivity           | CoPilot made productivity exponentially eaiser, when writing similar functions like those reading CSV files, it turned a tedious process into one finished in seconds. This helped with motivation as well, because not doing the tedious repetitive parts of the code allowed me to focus on implementing the more complex and interesting logic. The fact that it can also add comments to the code on my behalf helped alot during the debugging and maintenance phase.| One way it hindered productivity is due to the fact that CoPilot doesn't always get everything right. This means Sometimes I'd autocomplete a chunk of code which would turn out to give me a bus error or a segmentation fault. This would cause a lot of confusion for me, making me spend more time than I would need to if I had depended on my own knowledge over CoPilot's.                 |
