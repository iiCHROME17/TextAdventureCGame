## Analysis of effect of CoPilot on Pat's coding

| Impact                   | Positive         | Negative    |
|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| on Learning                | A strength  is that it enables reverse engineering. Anyone with some capacity for programming but not necessarily a knowledge of C may be able to understand the video and the code since Copilot is able to produce such well-maintained code. This would be by the power of deduction, for example, a comment above a for loop would explain to us what happens in the loop, what is being checked, and what is being iterated. This gives a basic understanding of the programming language's syntax and eliminates some of the need for professional assistance. If a student can look at a piece of code and use Copilot to explain some of its functionality, this boosts their understanding of the programming language and allows them to replicate and create similar programs. This shows that Copilot is not only useful for productivity but also learning.   | An observation made from the video suggests that Copilot could hinder learning. In the video, a large amount of code written Is done so by Copilot rather than the developers themselves. This is not an issue for more experienced developers who understand programming languages on a large scale as it purely is a means of saving time. However, the problem lies with inexperienced developers.  If a developer who does not know how to code uses Copilot too much, they will never fully understand the language.  It promotes a “shortcut” but these shortcuts aren’t necessarily helpful when learning because they don’t teach us why or how, they just give us the solution. In an academic sense, if one piece of coursework encourages the use of AI like CoPilot but another does not, this could be harmful to the student's grades. The fact that Copilot can allow amateur developers to create complex programs may seem like an advantage, however, if we remove Copilot from this developer's set of tools, will they be able to produce equally as complex programs? This shows that while Copilot is useful for learning, moderation is still a key factor, it should not be used as a crutch, but as a tool for learning.|
| on Productivity           | A strength of Copilot is that it can create assumptions from comments. This is seen several times in the video, especially toward the beginning where we define what the game is and what elements it needs. This is especially useful when it comes to productivity because it allows the suggestions Copilot uses to be far more accurate and relevant to the program we are creating. This in turn, means that Copilot can save developers time and they do not have to write code line by line. Prototyping projects using Copilot would be much faster than doing everything manually allowing programmers to allocate more time to debugging and testing for a more refined version of the program. This is one-way Copilot has shown itself to be beneficial.  | Copilot is not always accurate. There are a few instances in the video in which Copilot has made suggestions that do not represent what we need the code to do. Copilot assumed the game needed a main menu towards the start of the program, which was inaccurate. This shows that despite all the comments we make, Copilot can never truly understand what a developer intends for the program to be structured like and sometimes it is necessary to do things yourself. The fact that it is liable to inaccuracy can generate problems if left unchecked, for example, more bugs may occur, or the code may be harder to maintain due to the program’s functions not being stored structurally. This would impact productivity because it means, that although we have eliminated some time we’ve spent programming, we now must spend more time refactoring and debugging the code.                   |

## Analysis of effect of CoPilot on my programming for tasks 3 and 4

| Impact                   | Positive         | Negative    |
|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| on Learning                | Gave a better understanding of C, I was able to use CoPilot to reverse-engineer a lot of code and deduce things. This allowed me to understand things clearly such as datastructures, pointers (to some degree) and the overall code structure of the program. It also helped with learning some C-specific principles like Forward-declarations and memory allocation. Overall, Thanks to CoPilot and other sources, I would probably be able to build something similar  and actually understand each component of it.   | Sometimes Copilot taught me the wrong thing or suggested something completely incorrect. This did not only hinder my Productivity, but it also confused me alot and caused my to doubt my understanding of C. This led to me needing to refer to non-AI based information at certain points to get back on track. WHile it may of helped me learning C, it also wasn't always a smooth and streamlined learning experience; there were many ups and many downs.|
| on Productivity           | CoPilot made productivity exponentially eaiser, when writing similar functions like those reading CSV files, it turned a tedious process into one finished in seconds. This helped with motivation as well, because not doing the tedious repetitive parts of the code allowed me to focus on implementing the more complex and interesting logic. The fact that it can also add comments to the code on my behalf helped alot during the debugging and maintenance phase.| One way it hindered productivity is due to the fact that CoPilot doesn't always get everything right. This means Sometimes I'd autocomplete a chunk of code which would turn out to give me a bus error or a segmentation fault. This would cause a lot of confusion for me, making me spend more time than I would need to if I had depended on my own knowledge over CoPilot's.                 |
